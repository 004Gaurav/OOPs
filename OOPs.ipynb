        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which contain data (attributes) and behavior (methods). It focuses on modularity, reusability, and scalability.\n",

        "### **Key Concepts of OOP**  \n",

        "3. **Encapsulation** – Restricts direct access to data within an object to protect its integrity.  \n",
        "4. **Inheritance** – A mechanism that allows a new class to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class.  \n",
        "5. **Polymorphism** – The ability to define methods in different classes with the same name, but with different behaviors.  \n",

        " 3. **Access Control**: Python doesn't have strict access control like other languages (e.g., Java or C++), but by convention, private attributes (those with double underscores) are not meant to be accessed directly outside the class.\n",

Static methods are defined using the **`@staticmethod`** decorator and are often used for utility functions or operations that don't require access to the instance or class.\n",

        "\n",
        " Polymorphism allows different classes to share the same method names but with different behaviors. In Python, it works naturally with **inheritance** through method overriding.  \n",
        "\n",
        " #### **1. Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)**  \n",
        " A subclass overrides a method from its parent class.  \n",
        "\n",
        " ```python\n",
        " class Animal:\n",
        "     def speak(self): return \"Some sound\"\n",
        "\n",
        " class Dog(Animal):\n",

        " #### **2. Method Overloading (Pythonic Way)**  \n",
        " Python doesn't support traditional method overloading but allows default arguments.  \n",

        " #### **3. Polymorphism with Abstract Base Classes**  \n",
        " The `abc` module enforces method implementation in subclasses.  \n",
        "\n",
        " ```python\n",

        "\n",
        " **Method chaining** is a technique where multiple methods are called on an object **sequentially** in a **single statement**. It works by returning `self` (the instance) from each method, allowing further method calls.  \n",
        "\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        " The `__call__` method allows an instance of a class to be **called like a function**. This makes the object **callable**, meaning we can use `object()` syntax instead of calling a separate method.  \n",
        "\n",
        " #### **Example: Making an Object Callable**  \n",
        " ```python\n",

        " print(double(5))  # Output: 10\n",
        " ```\n",
        " Here, `double(5)` is equivalent to `double.__call__(5)`.  \n",
        "\n",
        " ### **Use Cases**\n",
        "  1. **Function-like objects** (e.g., decorators, callbacks)  \n",
        "  2. **Encapsulating logic** without explicitly naming a method  \n",
